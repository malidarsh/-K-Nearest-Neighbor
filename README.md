# K-Nearest-Neighbor
KNN which stand for K Nearest Neighbor is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm that classifies a new data point into the target class, depending on the features of its neighboring data points.
Features of kNN: 
1)Supervised Learning Algorithm
2)Simple
3)Non-Parametric
4)Classification and Regression Algorithm
5)Based on feature similarity
6)Lazy Algorithm
